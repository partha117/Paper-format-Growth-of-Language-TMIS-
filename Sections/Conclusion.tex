\label{sec:conclusion}
In this study, we analyze the reflection of the growth of new languages on Stack Overflow, i.e., how the activity pattern of Stack Overflow users changes along with the growth of the resources of the language and the expected time of availability of adequate resources. We show that our findings can help not only developers but also language owners and Stack Overflow to support the growth of new languages. In the early stages of new programming languages, documentation is not very rich and it is likely to be enriched with time. The impact of quality of documentation on the growth of new languages can be a new avenue for our future work.

We showed how our findings can help not only developers but also language owners and  Stack Overflow to support the growth of new languages.
